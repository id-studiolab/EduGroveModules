Two cost-effective, Grove-compatible board designs for the VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor.

## Version 1

A compact adapter board that facilitates the use of a cost-effective, widely-available 6-pin breakout design for the VL53L0X sensor with the Grove ecosystem.

- **Type**: Adapter Board
- **Size**: 16 x 16 mm
- **Mounting**: Provided by the original breakout board

## Version 2

A slightly larger board that natively incorporates the VL53L0X sensor into its design.

- **Type**: Integrated Sensor Board
- **Size**: 20 x 20 mm
- **Mounting**: Two 2.75mm diameter mounting holes along the top edge
